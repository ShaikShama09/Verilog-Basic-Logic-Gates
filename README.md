# Verilog-Basic-Logic-Gates

This repository contains the Verilog implementations of basic logic gates using all three modeling styles:
✅ Gate-Level Modeling
✅ Dataflow Modeling
✅ Behavioral Modeling

Each logic gate is tested using a testbench and verified using waveform simulation in Vivado 2017.4.
